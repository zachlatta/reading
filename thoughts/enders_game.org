* Ender's Game

One of my favorite books, was great to read it again. I'm probably on the third
read now and I come away with a different interpretation each time.

I never noticed the themes of absurdity before (it probably helps that I
recently read The Stranger). Ender is constantly lost trying to find happiness
in life. It's interesting because the meaning for his life is definitely
there---saving the world---but he can't help but feel like he's a pawn in a much
larger system. Even when his meaning is so clear, he still just wants to go home
and spend time with the people he loves.

One of my favorite things about the book is how the children aren't written
about as children, they're just as capable as any of the adults in the book. I
thought Card's preface put it best: "never in my entire childhood did I feel
like a child. I felt like a person all along---the same person that I am today".
I feel the same way.
