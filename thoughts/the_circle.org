* The Circle

Honestly was disappointed with this. The summary of the book got me super
excited -- techno-thriller set in a dystopia with themes of morality and
privacy, but it really, _really_ underdelivered. After I was halfway through, I
couldn't set the book down because I just wanted to get it over with. The
characters were shallow, the premise was implausible, and the plot was very
predictable.

Going to read a Neal Stephenson next, hopefully that'll make up for this.
