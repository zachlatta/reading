* The Man in the High Castle

Interesting read. It's about an alternate reality where World War II was won by
the Axis and the world is divided between Japan and Germany. The book itself
takes place in San Francisco, which is owned by Japan (Japan got the West coast
and Germany the East).

I had a good amount of trouble following the author's writing style, especially
in the beginning. Lots of characters were introduced and I had trouble keeping
track of them all (though this may have been because I let myself be interrupted
while reading).

The ending of the book wasn't really conclusive. It felt more like a vignette of
a potential, different reality than a novel with a traditional plot. It was an
enjoyable, relatively quick read though.
